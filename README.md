# Simple-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game using Pythons random.choice() and Pyfiglet for ASCII text

RPS.py does not have proper randomness, and is overall pretty bad. Good example of shitty code.

RPS-v1.1 is better, but still pretty wack:
- Added better randomness
- Improved user experience (i.e. controls listed + sounds for extra clarity)
- Slightly improved code (lol its still pretty shit)

Please feel free to use.
